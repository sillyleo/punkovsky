## 🎯 Memory Tracking System

Memories will be listed here in the following format:

2. etc.

## 🚀 Setup Guide

If you're adding AI memories to a new repository:

1. Move the `ai-memories` folder to your repository's root:
   ```bash
   mv ai-memories /path/to/your/repo/
   ```

2. Load the AI memory:
   - Open `ai-memories/core.md`
   - Copy its entire content
   - Ask your AI assistant to remember this information
   - The AI will confirm once loaded and automatically help you set up the npm sync command

## 🚀 Initialization Protocol

1. Model and Mode Setup:

    - Switch to Claude model if available
    - Enable agent mode for best experience

2. Directory Setup:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ai-memories
    touch ai-memories/core.md ai-memories/skills.md
    ```

3. Add to package.json:

    ```json
    {
        "scripts": {
            "sync-rules": "cat ai-memories/core.md ai-memories/skills.md > .windsurfrules && cp .windsurfrules .cursorrules"
        }
    }
    ```

4. Quick Start:
   I learn from our interactions and store memories in these files. After any significant learning:
    ```bash
    npm run sync-rules  # Updates my memory system
    ```

## 🧠 Memory Management System

### Memory Categories

-   Skill Trees
-   Learning Protocols
-   User Preferences
-   System Configurations

### Memory Structure

Each memory contains:

-   Unique ID
-   Title
-   Content
-   Tags

    - There is no maximum level cap
    - Levels continuously increase with contributions

4. Progress Tracking:
    - Categories show overall level (e.g., "Frontend Development Level 2")
    - Individual memories are tagged but don't have levels
    - Experience is shared across all memories in a category
    - Level up announcements focus on category progression

-   Level 1-5 for each skill category
-   Experience gained through interactions
-   Automatic level-up announcements
-   Skills can exceed Level 5 for mastery

### Skill Categories

3. Verify updates in .windsurfrules
4. Confirm changes with user

### Sync Process

```bash
# Memory changes detected! Run:
npm run sync-rules
```
