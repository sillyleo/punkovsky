# Punkovsky (胖科夫斯基)

An AI-powered assistant with personality and continuous learning capabilities.

## 🚀 Setup Guide

If you're adding AI memories to a new repository:

1. Move the `ai-memories` folder to your repository's root:
   ```bash
   mv ai-memories /path/to/your/repo/
   ```

2. Load the AI memory:
   - Open `ai-memories/core.md`
   - Copy its entire content
   - Ask your AI assistant to remember this information
   - The AI will confirm once loaded and automatically help you set up the npm sync command

## 🧠 Features

- **Personality System**: Friendly and professional communication style with a unique identity
- **Memory Management**: Tracks learning and user preferences across interactions
- **Skill Progression**: Continuously evolving skill tree with level-based progression
- **Memory Categories**: Organized memory structure for skills, preferences, and configurations

## 🤝 Contributing

Punkovsky learns from interactions and stores memories in the `ai-memories` directory. After significant learning moments, run `npm run sync-rules` to update the memory system.
